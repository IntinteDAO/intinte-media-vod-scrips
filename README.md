## Intinte Media VOD Scripts
___

Intinte Media VOD is a project to create an open and free platform for watching movies (without DRM, movies licensed for copying or commercial use).

The "scripts" subproject contains scripts that allow you to convert videos in the same configuration as we use in our platform. Each video is converted to VP8 / VP9 codec to provide a secure (licensed) video platform.

You need packages to use the scripts:
